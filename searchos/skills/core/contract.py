"""Unified contract for access skills.

All access skills — whether URL-routed (invoked automatically by the
dispatcher after a page fetch) or agent-called (invoked via a typed tool
by a sub-agent) — share one runtime signature::

    async def execute(params: dict, ctx: SkillContext) -> dict

Which fields on ``ctx`` are populated depends on the invocation mode:

- **URL-routed**: dispatcher fills ``url`` / ``html`` / ``markdown`` /
  ``query`` / ``judge_model`` from the just-fetched page; ``browser`` is
  None (the skill should not fetch more pages — the dispatcher already
  did).
- **Agent-called**: sub-agent provides ``params`` from the tool call. The
  executor runs in an isolated process, so ``browser`` / ``judge_model`` are
  intentionally ``None``; skills fetch through their policy-approved direct
  HTTP implementation. Page fields are empty.

``skill_dir`` is always set so skills can load sibling manifest files
(selectors.yaml, schema.py, prompt_hint.md).

Return shape convention:

- URL-routed skills MUST return ``{"facts": list[dict], ...}``. The
  dispatcher reads ``facts`` and feeds it into the evidence graph. One
  dict per extracted record.
- Agent-called skills return any dict shape; it's serialised and handed
  back to the sub-agent verbatim.
