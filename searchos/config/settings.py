"""Pydantic Settings — single source of truth for SearchOS configuration.

Secrets (API keys) stay in ``.env``, referenced by ``api_key_env`` name.
Per-field env override via the ``SF_`` prefix and ``__`` delimiter:

    SF_ROLES__JUDGE=glm5-strong
    SF_PROFILES__GLM5_STRONG__TEMPERATURE=0.0

Partial overrides deep-merge onto the defaults (a lone ``SF_ROLES__JUDGE``
keeps the other 11 role bindings). Profile keys in env vars may use ``_``
in place of ``-`` (env names can't contain hyphens).

``profiles`` = named model endpoints; ``roles`` = role→profile bindings.
Every model use site resolves through ``config.models.get_model_for(role)``.
``SF_`` prefix retained for backward compat with existing ``.env`` files.

Open-source one-knob setup: set ``SF_PROVIDER`` (see ``config.providers``)
and profiles/roles defaults are generated for that vendor.

Layout of this module (full layering story in ``docs/configuration.md``):

    ModelProfile / ROLE_NAMES / builtin defaults   → config/profiles.py (re-exported)
    provider presets (SF_PROVIDER)                 → config/providers.py
    .env read/write                                → config/env_file.py
    effort tiers                                   → config/effort.py
    Settings sections below: models → budget → scheduler → harness →
    workspace → skills → search → browser → memory → extraction → ablation

The ``settings`` singleton is an import-time snapshot of the environment;
after changing env vars at runtime call ``reload_settings_in_place()``.
