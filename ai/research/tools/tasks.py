    report already covered the same rows, or a task turned out to be
    mis-scoped.

    Keyed by TASK id (the ids you got back from ``enqueue_tasks`` /
    see in scheduler_actions), not agent id — the task is what you
    created and track. Effects per task:
    - PENDING / BLOCKED: removed from the queue (marked CANCELLED).
    - RUNNING: its assigned sub-agent is cancelled too, freeing the pool
      slot immediately; the Scheduler backfills on the next tick.
      Evidence the agent already flushed stays in the state, and a
      "cancelled" report (with its delta so far) is registered.
    - COMPLETED / CANCELLED: rejected (already terminal).

    Do NOT stop a kind=write task unless you intend to respawn the writer.

    Args:
        task_ids_json: JSON array of task ids, e.g. '["t_a1b2c3d4"]'.
        reason: short note recorded on the task resolution and the
