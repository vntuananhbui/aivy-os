"""Simple Browser tools (paper §4.2): ``search`` / ``open`` / ``find``.

- ``search(query)`` — hit list.
- ``open(id_or_url, loc=0)`` — render a search-result id or URL as a
  line-numbered page; ``loc`` scrolls the view window.
- ``find(pattern)`` — grep the current page; matches become a new
  addressable page (so ``open(<id>)`` on a match scrolls to it).

These are thin shells over ``state`` (browser session) and ``render``
(HTML→markdown). Page fetching is delegated to ``backend``.

          • **Full URL** (``"https://..."``) — always valid, stateless. Prefer this when iterating across many hits, when ids might collide across multiple search() calls (the id 0 from search #2 isn't the same hit as id 0 from search #1), or when the URL is already in your reasoning trace.

        loc (int): starting line number for the rendered window (0-indexed). The page renders ~80 lines from this point. Ignored when ``id_or_url`` is a find-match id (auto-jumps to the match line).

Prefer the most discriminating word that's likely to be present literally (a name, a number, a unit, a code) and let the surrounding context window do the rest. If a 1-token find returns no hit, the answer is more likely not on this page than that you need a longer pattern.

Pass a list of strings to OR several alternates in one call (e.g. ``find(["keyword1", "keyword2", ...])``) -- a line is a match if any pattern is a substring (case-insensitive). When a single-string call returns no exact hit, the response includes a ``[FUZZY]`` block with the closest tokens on the page; switch to one of those tokens rather than re-issuing a near-duplicate of the original pattern.
