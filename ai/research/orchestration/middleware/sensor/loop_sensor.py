"""LoopSensor: detect search loops on every tool call.

Four detection modes:
1. **No-progress** — tool result is empty/error for N consecutive steps
2. **Search-without-reading** — bare `search` called multiple times without
   an open / find (warns the agent to actually read)
3. **Query-repetition nudge** — the exact same query issued N times in a
   sliding window (catches Run-3 "agent_2 searched site:icst.pku.edu.cn
   10 times" pattern). Mode 3 fires ONE inject_message per unique query
   and moves on.
4. **Query-repetition hard-loop → state write** — if Mode 3 keeps firing
   (cumulative repetition escalation ≥ threshold), give up on nudging and
   mark the agent as ``looped`` via workspace state. The graph finishes
   its current turn naturally; the next ``check_agents`` pickup converts
   this into ``AgentReport(status="looped")`` and the orchestrator decides
   whether to continue_agent the same agent with a different angle or
   spawn a fresh one.
