"""DispatchRoundSensor: hard-cap orchestrator dispatch rounds at the
harness layer.

``settings.orch_max_dispatches`` is the intended cap.
orchestrator_prompt renders it as "Max orchestrator dispatch rounds: N"
but that's soft — the LLM can and does ignore it, overshooting the cap
with extra rescue rounds that spawn more sub-agents and waste tokens.

This sensor counts ``dispatch_agent`` / ``dispatch_agents`` tool calls
on the orchestrator middleware. Each call = 1 round regardless of how
many agents ``dispatch_agents`` spawns — matches the "round" framing
in the prompt. On the max-th call, the sensor fires:
  - ``force_stop`` (prompt-level HARD STOP on next model turn)
  - ``hard_block_tools`` for dispatch_agent / dispatch_agents
    (handler-layer short-circuit for subsequent attempts)

Does NOT block ``check_agents`` (LLM still needs to collect results
from the dispatches that already ran) or ``synthesize_answer``
(the whole point is to push LLM there).

Explore is harness-prepended and runs before the orchestrator is built,
so it bypasses this sensor entirely — counter starts at 0 on the first
real orchestrator-side dispatch.
