"""HarnessMiddleware: budget enforcement + Sensors around the agent loop.

This is the core middleware that makes an ordinary agent loop into a
SearchSession-controlled loop. It implements the ``AgentMiddleware`` protocol
from ``deepagents``.

Lightweight sensors (budget / loop-detection / dispatch caps) fire on *every*
tool call. Multi-dimensional budgets (iterations / wall-clock / per-tool
counts) are enforced here: exhausted dimensions block their own tool kind,
and full exhaustion hard-blocks all work-initiating tools while injecting
wrap-up guidance on the next model turn.

        Pure containment — no tokenization, no stopword list, no language
        assumption. Two-pass:

        1. Full canonical name (``Apollo 1``, ``Tesla|2024``,
           ``2019|James Peebles``) appears verbatim in the task. Catches
           the common case where the orchestrator enumerates the entities
           ("Extract data for Apollo 1, Apollo 7, Apollo 8...").
        2. For composite PKs (``a|b|c``), any individual component appears
           in the task. Catches the case where the task scopes by one
           PK column (e.g. ``"2019 winners"`` covers ``2019|James Peebles``,
           ``2019|Michel Mayor``, ... — they share PK component ``2019``).

        Edge cases (deliberate behavior):
        - ``"Apollo 1"`` matches any task containing the literal string —
          including ``"Apollo 11"``. False positive in the rare case where
          a task explicitly only wants Apollo 11; the SOCM render would
          show Apollo 1 as in-scope too. Acceptable cost vs. degrading to
          discovery view.
        - Range syntax (``"Apollo 7-17"``) only matches Apollo 7 / Apollo 17
          literally; Apollo 8-16 fall through to discovery view. The
          orchestrator can avoid this by enumerating (traces show it
          usually does anyway).
        - Single-character / very-short PK components (``A``, ``1``)
          would substring-match almost any task. We require PK components
          to be ≥ 2 chars to avoid this — single chars / single digits
          are too noisy as standalone PKs anyway and rarely appear.
