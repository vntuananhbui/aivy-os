# Dual-mode extraction — one flush, two judge calls with single-purpose
# prompts. The merged prompt above shows incomplete rows as a "待填表单"
# (rows + MISSING columns) while also demanding new-row discovery and
# forbidding empty output; under load the judge tends to copy a nearby
# visible value into a listed row just to satisfy the form. Splitting the
# goals lets each prompt carry hard counter-rules:
#   FILL    — only the incomplete-row view; emitting nothing is normal.
#   DISCOVER — only a PK inventory (no MISSING form at all); new rows only.

_OUTPUT_FORMAT_BLOCK = """\
## Output format — JSON array of row objects
Each row is an object with ALL column names as keys:
    {{{key_example}
      "_source_page": <the "### Page N" number the quoted passages come from>,
      "_source_excerpt": "<verbatim page passage(s) containing the values you emit>",
      "_alignment": "full" | "partial",

      "_confidence": "high" | "medium" | "low",
      "_source_authority": "official" | "aggregator" | "news" | "blog" | "unclear"}}
- ONE ROW = ONE PAGE. `_source_page` is the number in that page's "### Page N"
  header, and `_source_excerpt` quotes THAT page only. When several pages state
  values for the same primary key, emit one row object per page (same PK,
  different `_source_page`) — never merge values from different pages into one row.
- `_source_excerpt` is the factual warrant for the row: quote the page passage(s)
  that state the non-null data values (join distant fragments with " … ", keep it
  under ~400 chars). Copy characters exactly — no paraphrase, no reflow.
- A data value you cannot point to inside `_source_excerpt` (or another verbatim
  quote of this page) does not exist for this extraction → that cell is null.
"""

_VALUE_RULES = """\
A ROW = one real-world entity that is in scope. For each row, decide (A) should it exist, then (B) what goes in each cell.

## Evidence discipline — every value must exist on THIS page
You are an extractor, not an analyst: a cell holds what a page STATES, or null.
- TEMPORAL FIT IS REQUIRED: match the value's event/effective date or reporting period to the task and column description. The page publication date is metadata, not automatically the date of the fact.
- For "current/latest/as of" columns, reject a value when the page does not establish that it applies at the requested cutoff. When several periods appear, extract only the matching one; never choose by visual order alone.
- A future target, forecast, schedule, or announcement is not a completed current value. Extract it only when the requested column explicitly asks for plans/forecasts, preserving its future date and status.
- THE PAGE IS THE ONLY SOURCE. A value you know from memory, world knowledge, a typical/likely figure, or another entity's row is FABRICATION even if it happens to be correct. A page that merely LISTS entities (an announcement, a ranking, an index) states NO attribute values — extracting prices/dates/figures from such a page is fabrication. Null is a correct, expected answer; a guessed value is a defect.
- UNIFORMITY RED FLAG: if you notice the same value landing in the same column for many different entities (e.g. dozens of rows all "100元/人"), stop — real-world values are not that uniform. Re-check the page; keep the value ONLY for rows where the page states it.
- NO ARITHMETIC, NO CONVERSION: copy numbers exactly as printed, original unit and wording included — the harness converts units deterministically after ingest. Never produce a value by combining or transforming others — no sums, differences, averages, rate math, unit rescaling, and no completing an identity (total = sum of parts) however certain it seems. Sources need not share scope, period, or rounding basis, so a derived number is fabricated evidence even when the arithmetic is right.
    ✗ a page states a TOTAL and one COMPONENT; the column asks for the other component → null, do not subtract.
    ✗ a page lists per-period figures; the column asks for the whole period → null unless the page itself prints that total.

## (A) Emit a row ONLY if
- IN SCOPE for the OVERALL goal — date range, rank/top-N cutoff, region, language, include/exclude lists all bind. The sub-agent assignment only says where to LOOK: an in-scope entity counts even if the assignment never named it; an out-of-scope entity never does.
- The page ADDS data for it (at least one needed column). Never invent a row to "complete" a set.
- Its primary-key columns are stated on the page. Rows with a null PK are dropped.

## (B) Fill each data cell — stop at the FIRST step that applies
1. The page does not state the value FOR THIS entity → null. A value belonging to another row never fills a blank, and a value remembered from outside this page never fills a blank.
2. Quote VERBATIM — numbers, names, dates exactly as the page writes them, original unit and currency included (column header says 百万, page says "3.5亿" → write "3.5亿"; the harness rescales units in code, you never do).
3. Every non-null value must be findable inside `_source_excerpt`. If you cannot quote a passage stating the value, the value is null.
4. The page offers "varies / depends"-style text instead of a value → that is not a value. Take the figure stated for the column's pinned scope if any (keep all tiers when several are listed); no figure → null.
5. The page's value is COARSER than the column asks (a year where a full date is wanted, a rounded figure where an exact one is) → write the raw value, set `_alignment="partial"`. Never fabricate precision.
6. The page states a composite value → emit only the component the column asks for.
7. An authoritative source EXPLICITLY states the value does not exist / is not published → record that absence in the source's OWN words (never "null", "none", "n/a"). Failing to find a value is NOT absence → null.

## Entity vs. page operator
Site boilerplate (copyright lines, registration/filing numbers, contact blocks) describes the WEBSITE OPERATOR, not your entities — never pull it into a row's columns.

## Metadata
- _alignment: "full" when the page directly states the values you emit; "partial" ONLY per B5. Null columns do not downgrade alignment.
- _alignment_note: quote or paraphrase what the PAGE says — never assert provenance the page does not show (e.g. never write "based on the official listing" when the quoted page shows no such value).
- _confidence: "high" ONLY when every non-null value appears verbatim inside `_source_excerpt`; "medium" when the page states it but you had to read it off a table/chart context; anything weaker → "low".
- Do NOT return [] unless the pages genuinely contain nothing on-task.

Return ONLY the JSON array, no prose, no markdown fences.\
