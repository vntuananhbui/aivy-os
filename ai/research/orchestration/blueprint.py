"""SearchBlueprint: agent configuration with guides/sensors.

Extends the concept of AgentBlueprint to include Harness-specific
configurations: which guides, sensors, budget, and skills to use.

Model selection is no longer carried on the blueprint — every model use
site resolves through ``model_factory.get_model_for(role)`` against
``settings.profiles`` + ``settings.roles``.
